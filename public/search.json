E.g, shutdown the power source of the target crash your machine crash your router use up a key machine or network resource Using up resource is the most common approach network bandwidth processing power RAM Network stack resources E.g., records of open connections ( ) TCP connections via SYN flood OS or application resources E.g., entries in a hash table Simple Denial of Service Attacks One machine tries to overload another machine E.g., send more packets than the target can handle There is a fundamental problem for attacker: Attacker’s machine must be more powerful than the target machine Otherwise, the attack machine can’t generate enought packets this problem by 2 possibilities: 1. Sovling Find a way to make the target pay more per message than the attacker Use more than one machine to attack 1.Make the target pay more Denial of Service and Asymmetry If so, one attack machine can generate a lot of requests and effectively multiply its power E.g., send random garbage packets to machine expectig encrypted packets (obviously it have to decrypt those packets, which is an expensive process) sometimes generating a request is cheaper than formulating a repsonse Not always possible to achieve this asymmetry but often can be done An example is SYN Flood TCP is connection-oriented Endpoints must keep information about current tcp conn. for detecting loss of packet and doing flow contronl and managing congestion Typically kept in a table of - fixed size so attack this table not the bandwidth The TCP open connection table Design to support many TCP connections at a time.E.g., for high volume web server One entry per conn. reuse an entry once the connection ends some legitimate conns. will be slow The basic of attack Attacker uses initial req/resp to start tcp sessions then he abandons them target keeps them open for a while Filling up the server’s open connection table and prevening new real tcp sessions How to defense Don’t let the attacker take too many open connection slots Maybe restrict to 3 or 4 slots per IP addr Doesn’t help if attacker has a lot of machines and attacker spoofs IP addr Drops unused conns. more aggressively so half-open conns, don’t waste the resource as long bad impact on legitimate clients Save most of your slots for good IP addr, but how about IP Spoofing Make attacker pay more he must pay sth for getting the open conns. table entry if the cost is high enough, he can’t afford to fill my table so, what can we make him pay in ? currency The solution is using SYN Cookies Good aspects of this approach doesn’t change tcp protocol doesn’t require clients to do anything doesn’t require server to save any information can be turned on and off easily"},{"title":"Advanced network security note - 3rd day of class","url":"/blog/2014/08/20/third-day-of-advancded-network-security-class","date":"2014-08-20 00:00:00 +0700","categories":["network securtiy"],"body":" Authentication and Authorization in Network Security Authentication is determining who someone is Authorization is determining someone is allowed to do something Authorization usually depends one authentication, which properly is not sufficient Perimeter of Defense and networks: Firewall Perimeter Defense The idea is building an impenetrable perimeter around something valueable to protect it History of perimeter defense : castle, fortress, The Great Wall of China, etc. But they were all failed because of perimeter defense’s weaknesses Weaknesses of Perimeter Defense models Breaching the perimeter compromises all security 2 major assumptions: The barrier is impenetrable (It usually isn’t) We can carefully control the entrance and exit points (we often can’t) What is Firewall ?

But until last week, I’ve just figured out - a blogging framework for hackers - which is framework that helps making your pesonal blog or site become easier. And one of the most important reason that I love them is they are all free! Octopress In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to build a blog using Octopress. If you have already known about Jekyll, I suggest you should take a look on Octopress. Unless you have, you don’t need to know much about Jekyll because Octopress will handle it for you. First of all, we need to install and config a lot,but I’ll try to make it simple. Jekyll Installation To whom still don’t know, is a static site generator which helps you generate your site’s or blog’s contents ( usually written in Markdown) into static contents (e.g., html, css and javascript). In addition, Jekyll have been using GitHub Pages as their pages generator , so everything you write in Jekyll will easily host on Github. Jekyll Requirements - Read Ruby >= 1.9 if you don’t have Ruby installed this RubyGems Linux, Unix or MacOS Install via RubyGem ~/ 1 gem install jekyll $ Now you can easily start your site by ~/ 1 2 3 4 jekyll new my-blog $ $ my-blog cd my-blog jekyll serve $ # => Now browse to http://localhost:4000 By browsing above address you can see your beautifully simplified site now there. Early Deployment to Github Page Sign in into your GitHub account, create if you don’t have one Create a new repository with name like username.github.io E.g., my repo for this blog is rexey3s.github.io Now back to your console and make sure you have Git installed my-blog git commit -m $ 'Deloying my Jekyll Blog' my-blog git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<username>.github.io $ my-blog git push origin master ~/ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 apt-get install git $sudo my-blog $cd my-blog git init $ my-blog git add . $ $ Go to your browser and pointing to , as you can see your blog is now online without any 3rd party host. username.github.io If you want to build your site from scratch, you can carefully read the and again deloy it to GitHub Page. There are many options to deploy a Jekyll site, GitHub Page is just a free and awesome one. But if you want a quick and easy customizable site then continue reading. docs Octopress Installation Setup Octopress ~/ 1 2 3 mkdir myblog $ git clone git://github.com/imathis/octopress.git myblog $ $ myblog cd Install dependencies ~/myblog/ 1 2 myblog gem install bundler $ myblog bundle install $ - Choose your Install Octopress themes ~/myblog/ 1 2 3 4 myblog git submodule add GIT_THEME_URL .themes/THEME_NAME $ myblog rake install $ [ 'THEME_NAME' ] myblog rake generate $ # => Now browse to http://localhost:4000 Octopress config - Jekyll main config file _config.yml 11 12 myblog vim _config.yml $ # ----------------------- # # Main Configs # # ----------------------- # url: http://<username>.github.io title: \"put your blog title here\" subtitle: A blogging framework hackers. for author: me description: date_format: # Format dates using Ruby's date strftime syntax subscribe_rss: # Url for your blog's feed, defauts to /atom.xml subscribe_email: ~/myblog/ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 # Url to subscribe by email (service required) Note: After changing any configs in , you have to type _config.yml again to take effect rake generate Octopress bundled with a lot 3rd Party setting setting ~/myblog/ 1 myblog vim _config.yml $ 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 # # ----------------------- # rd Party Settings # 3 # # ----------------------- # Github github_user: YOUR_GITHUB # Twitter twitter_user: YOUR_TWTTTER_NAME twitter_tweet_button: true # Disqus Comments disqus_short_name: DISQUS_NAME disqus_show_comment_count: false # Facebook Like _config.yml 1 2 3 facebook_like: false Comments powered by Disqus - signup if you don’t have one Learn more about Octopress config Customize your blog Changing default theme and This blog uses Octostrap3 Bootwatch Readable ~/myblog/ 1 2 3 ~/myblog git clone https://github.com/kAworu/octostrap3 .themes/octostrap3 $ ~/myblog rake install $ octostrap3 [ ] ~/myblog rake generate $ Go to and choose the theme you like, then copy Bootwatch ‘s content and replace your bootstrap.min.css by its content. myblog/source/assets/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap-theme.min.css at Refresh your browser and check out the new look. localhost:4000/ Create About page About page title= \"Avatar\" /> </a> </div> <div class= \"col-xs-8 col-md-5\" > Write something about you <p> </p> </div> source/about/index.html 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 --- layout: page title: \"About\" footer: true navbar: About --- <div class= \"row\" > <div class= \"col-xs-8 col-md-3\" > <a href= \"#\" class= \"thumbnail\" > <img src= \"/images/bio-photo-alt.jpg\" </div> Then navigate to add the following snippet to inside source/_includes/custom/navigation.html tag div.navbar-collapse ~/myblog/source/_includes/custom/navigation.html 1 2 3 <li> <a href= \"/about/\" About > </a> </li> Deploy to GitHub pages Now, you don’t need to run anymore git will do it for you rake deploy ~/myblog/ 1 2 3 myblog rake preview $ myblog $ # => take a look at your blog on http://localhost:4000 before were deploy it myblog rake setup_github_pages $ The task will ask you for a URL of your Github Repo which can be one of 2 following forms: rake git@github.com:username/username.github.io.git https://github.com/username/username.github.io Deploying ~/myblog/ 1 2 myblog rake generate $ myblog rake deploy $ # You will be prompted for Github username and password Now go to and see your result. username.github.io One more important thing is to backup your Octopress’s code to Github too. In dir, ~/myblog/ a new git to push your source to a repo that would store your Octopress’s code. Note: You may not want to public your init file, then you can add it to _config.yml .gitignore ~/myblog/ 1 2 3 4 5 myblog git init $ myblog git remote add origin https://github.com/username/blog-src.git $ myblog git add . $ myblog git commit -m $ 'Backup src to ' source ' branch' myblog git push origin master $ Great, now your blog has been online, hosted by Github Page which is free of charge and also your source code has been subversioned by Github. Last but not least, I have to mention that your posts should been written in which allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, which then converts to valid HTML for viewing on GitHub or anywhere that has a Markdown Conversion Tool. I pretty sure that you will find it easier than writting you own HTML ;). Here is an example to illustrate my words: Markdown I have a code snippet jekyll serve Code snippet example 1 $ If I wrote it in HTML, it would be like this: </span> </code> </pre> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> </figure> </notextile> HTML elements of Code snippet example 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 <div class= \"bogus-wrapper\" > <notextile> <figure class= \"code\" > <figcaption> Code snippet example <span> </span> </figcaption> <div class= \"highlight\" > <table> <tbody><tr> <td class= \"gutter\" > <pre class= \"line-numbers\" > <span class= \"line-number\" 1 > </span> </pre> </td> <td class= \"code\" > <pre> <code class= \"sh\" > <span class= \"line\" ><span class= \"nv\" $ > jekyll serve </span> </div> Then I wrote it in Markdown, which would be easily generated to the HTML above HTML elements of Code snippet example 1 2 3 ```sh Code snippet example $ jekyll serve ``` As you have seen, “` is a syntax for code snippet and is specified the language that it would syntax highlighted for - is this example, It is sh . Markdown syntax is just beautiful and simplified. bash/shell Create a new post 1 myblog rake new_post $ [ \"this_is_the_title\" ~/myblog/ ] Then, go to to edit your new post, you can use any editor you like to write it in Markdown syntax. myblog/source/_posts/ : the filename of your post would be in the following form Note - you should not change its year-month-day-title.md prefix. date So now you would be able to deploy your site online and create a new post. Please take a look at Markdown syntax link below, it will help you a lot when writing your post. Happy blogging!

I now feel it need to be a balance between “Do what you love” and “Love what you do”. Love what you do so you can maintain and grow what you love. One more piece of art in this article that the quote from the author that I feel damn true “Don’t do something you hate for a living. Whatever you love should love you back. And if it’s not working out, it’s ok to find something else to love.” I have 46 Thanksgiving dinners left with family. And then, I’ll be dead. A little bit tragic when reading this, it reminds me about what Steve Job had said in his speech at Stanford “Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important” Here is the which was mentioned in the article. app’s link Great Tips 5 Email Tips for Intense People Reading for fun If Hemingway wrote JavaScript Beautiful metaphor about Js coding style by the writing style of great writers."}]}
