    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi all, here is the reading list of week 2</p>

<h2 id="stories-on-mediumhttpsmediumcom">Stories on <a href="https://medium.com">@Medium</a></h2>

<h3 id="the-power-of-your-writinghttpsmediumcomwynlimthe-power-of-your-writing-c235ee82e603"><a href="https://medium.com/@wynlim/the-power-of-your-writing-c235ee82e603">The power of your writing</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li>This is the reason why I start this God <em>damn</em> blog =)). Absolutely must-read article.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="reasons-why-you-will-never-do-anything-amazing-with-your-lifehttpsmediumcomraymmars-reads7-reasons-why-you-will-never-do-anything-amazing-with-your-life-2a1841f1335d"><a href="https://medium.com/raymmars-reads/7-reasons-why-you-will-never-do-anything-amazing-with-your-life-2a1841f1335d">7 Reasons Why You Will Never Do Anything Amazing With Your Life</a></h3>

<!-- more -->

<p class="text-justify">Hmm, I have to admit that I myself caught up with 4 of 7 reasons on the list: </p>

<ol>
  <li><code>I havn't failed enough </code> 
    <ul>
      <li>Maybe try to become a failure in near future</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code>I still care about others think about me</code>
    <ul>
      <li>Damn, sometime I just want to f**k all the thing up but I don’t have enough courage. But brace yourself I forge my sword, day by day <br /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code>I don't ask enough questions</code>
    <ul>
      <li>To me, asking the right question is much more important than the quantity, but the problem is how do you know the right question if you don’t ask until you find it right ;))</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code>I 'm probably not a person who could handle and accept the truth easily</code></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="dont-do-what-you-lovehttpsmediumcomrachelnaborsdont-do-what-you-love-41312c943e2"><a href="https://medium.com/@rachelnabors/dont-do-what-you-love-41312c943e2">Don’t do what you love</a></h3>

<p class="text-justify">A few thoughts came out of my head after reading this controverial stuff. I now feel it need to be a balance between “Do what you love” and “Love what you do”. Love what you do so you can maintain and grow what you love. One more piece of art in this article that the quote from the author that I feel damn true</p>

<blockquote class="text-justify">
  <p>“Don’t do something you hate for a living. Whatever you love should love you back. And if it’s not working out, it’s ok to find something else to love.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="i-have-46-thanksgiving-dinners-left-with-family-and-then-ill-be-deadhttpsmediumcombenhuhi-have-46-thanksgiving-dinners-left-with-my-family-after-that-ill-be-dead-ab4cb249eadf"><a href="https://medium.com/@benhuh/i-have-46-thanksgiving-dinners-left-with-my-family-after-that-ill-be-dead-ab4cb249eadf">I have 46 Thanksgiving dinners left with family. And then, I’ll be dead.</a></h3>

<p class="text-justify">A little bit tragic when reading this, it reminds me about what Steve Job had said in his speech at Stanford</p>

<blockquote class="text-justify">
  <p>“Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is the <a href="http://seeyourfolks.com/">app’s link</a> which was mentioned in the article.</p>
