>Thanks for visiting my site! My name is Chuong Dang, I am a last year student from University of Information and Technology, HCMC, Vietnam. My major is Network and Telecommunication, so there is no doubt that anythings related to network or www always make me interested. Especially, the Agile Web Developments technologies such as Nodejs, Rails, Jekyll, etc. attracts most of my attention.

>I didn't use to have habits of reading and writing, but recently I have figured out that how reading and writing could help me improve my characteristics and my critical thinking a lot. Obviously, this blog is where I could improve my writing skill by writing about my view, study or some interesting around the Internet. Feel free to give any recommendations, suggestions or feedbacks about my posts, theirs contents, my site design. You can easily do it by leaving your comments in the comments section in any post you want to give me any feedbacks.
