## Articles

### [How quitting my corporate job for my startup dream f*cked my life](https://medium.com/everything-about-startups-and-entrepreneurship/how-quitting-my-corporate-job-for-my-startup-dream-f-cked-my-life-up-3b6b3e29b318)

A great and must-read article for who desire to become an entrepreneur. The author mentioned a lot a things need to prepare before quiting daily job to start your own business. I particularly love the part he described the social pressure which would come from your friends, your family when you decide to start your start up dream.
