It's been a month since I knew about GitHub Page and Jekyll - 2 awesome things which powered this blog you're reading. But until last week, I've just figured out Octopress - another cool thing that help me personelize this blog. And they are all free !

In this tutorial, I'll guide you step-to-step from installation to deployment of your blog on GitHub Page.
<br>
<h3>Installation Jekyll</h3>
Jekyll is a static site generator - more on [Jekyllrb](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/). [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) uses it, so everything you write in Jekyll will easily host on Github. 
<h4>Requirements</h4>
* **Ruby >= 1.9** - Read [this](https://gorails.com/setup) if you don't have Ruby installed   
* **RubyGems**
